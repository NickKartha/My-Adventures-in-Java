# My-Adventures-in-Java
These are Java programs that I've done for my Object Oriented Design class. You're welcome to edit the code and fix any logical error or improve efficiency and readability. Feel free to play around with it.

You require the Java Dev Kit (JDK) to run these programs. Get the latest JDK from https://java.com/en/download/

To run a `.java` program, please do the following
 - Save program as `filename.java`
 - Open command prompt or terminal and add `javac.exe` and `java.exe` to the path, if not already there
 -  To complie: Run `javac filename.java`
 - To execute : Run `java filename`
 
 Note: While saving, please ensure the `filename` is the same as the main classname.
